                        This project was designed with the desire to inform and 
                        share fun facts about the city of chicago. It is meant to 
                        let those who call themselves "true Chicagoans" to back 
                        that statement up, and it also provides an environment for 
                        someone who doesn't know much about the city to learn some 
                        new and interesting facts.

                        While fully functional now and a 
                        clear demonstration of my skills as a developer, my hope 
                        is to continue to develop this web app and create an 
                        education resource for schools to use when teaching students 
                        about Chicago.

                    A summary section. As a lover of craft beer and of the variety of styles that can be 
                    found around the United States, I wanted to create a web app that allows others to find 
                    local breweries in their city. Users can search for any number of breweries in their 
                    city (up to 50 at a time) and learn where the brewery is located.
