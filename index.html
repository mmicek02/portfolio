                    Hey there! I'm Mike and I am a fullstack developer, who gets stars in his eyes 
                    when talking about UI/IX.

                    I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Web Developer Career Path 
                    bootcamp at Bloc. Web design has always been a passion of mine, and now I do 
                    it for a living. Creating interactive user experiences using inclusive design 
                    philosophies and properties is what wakes me up in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've come a long way in a very short time and have learned by doing (and love 
                    that process). I work very hard to develop clear clean code and always push 
                    myself to improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not coding, I am designing quick and fun board games for my friends 
                    and I to play or attempting a new homebrew beer recipe.
